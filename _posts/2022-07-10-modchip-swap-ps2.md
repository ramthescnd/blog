title: Goodbye DMS3, Welcome Matrix Infinity
published: true
---

So quite a while back somebody at my working place threw a Playstation 2 (SCPH-3900) away. While you should not just throw electronics away, I was there to rescue it. I sold my PS2 when I was 10 years old, because I did not need it anymore (upgraded to a PS3). I thought that it was a nice way to "feel nostalgic" again. When I was home I noticed that the console was actually working flawlessly. I took it apart, and what did I find üòè?

Well, it was quite common to have a chipped console back in the day. But this chip was very special, it was an original DMS3! That chip is 20 years old and it was one of the best at its time. I could not find any Installation Diagrams, only a bunch of forum posts from 2005/2007. 
I bought a Matrix Infinity Clone to replace the DMS3. Not because the DMS3 was broken or something. I actually updated it and had it running. But you know as time moves forward, modchips keep evolving. The "Modbo 5.0" has more features, that why I chose to replace it. 

Firstly I desoldered the DMS3, and checked all the connected pins for possible shorts. Solder blobs can land anywhere ü§ì.

Here is quick size comparison of the two chips:

Is it not fascinating that a 20 year old modchip is almost twice the size as a current "year-made"?   
I am going to keep the DMS3, just for the fun of it.

Now it is time for the ModBo 5.0 to be installed. Pre-tinning first though üòÖ.

And now for the installation of the ModBo, I mean its pretty "basic". It uses the same points as the DMS3.  
To be fair, the installation was a real breeze. With the right iron & tip anything is possible I guess ü§∑.

Yes I know, the cable management is poor. And Yes, I also know that there are people out there that create real art with modchips installations (s/o to [Voultar](https://www.youtube.com/c/Voultar)). But I do not plan to sell the console, so in my opinion it does not really matter in this case.

And as at it turns out it works!

The menu looks absolutely gorgeous, it can be accessed by holding "Circle" & "Triangle" when you power on the console. This chip can also play Playstation 1 games that are either burned on a DVD/CD-R or imported legit games. Im using my PS2 in combination with "FreeMcBoot". That is the ultimate combination. What I did notice about this console though is that it does not read the internal HDD. It just straight up refuses, it does not even say "HDD not found". I found out that a blown fuse "PS09" is the reason why. I am going to replace that in the future, it is not my number one priority right now.

So anyways, that was it for today.
See you all when the stuff I ordered for the NES is here. Goodbye üëã.
