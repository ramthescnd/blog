Hello again, it's been a while üëã.
While I was gone (and relaxed a little bit on my weekend), I worked on my Nintendo Switch. 
You see, Im one of the rare guys that has the first hardware revision of the Switch (HAC-001), also known as "Erista".  
Yes, these are the ones that are vulnerable to the infamous "RCM-Exploit" (you can click <a href="https://www.ktemkin.com/faq-fusee-gelee/">here</a> for more infos on that).

Anyways, when launching a so called "payload" through a usb host (eg. a pc) you will always need to go into "RCM mode" first. You do that by bridging specific points on right joycon rail (it could be 9 & 10, or 7 & 10 for example). Of course you could always bridge these with a paperclip, a small strip of aluminum foil, etc.. 

I had a spare joycon and just bridged the datapoints (9 & 10) on the actual rail of it ü§∑.

So every time I wanna launch a payload (eg. a custom firmware called <a href="https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere">Atmosph√®re</a>), I can plug the "modded" joycon in and launch the payload via my phone (with <a href="https://github.com/MenosGrante/Rekado">this</a> awesome app). 
After that I made a copy of my  system NAND to my SD-card with <a href="https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate">this</a> awesome bootloader named "hekate".

<ins>So? All that work, for what?</ins>

Well a modded Switch is awesome, here a couple of reasons: 

* Emulators (Retroarch ‚ù§Ô∏è)  
* Modding Games  
* Overclocking your Switch  
* Run Linux üêß  
* Modding Gamesaves  
* Install Homebrew
* Custom Themes

Yes, you can also install "free games", but Im strongly advising <ins>not</ins> to do so. You are hurting hard working game developers, and you are also putting your Console at a huge risk of getting banned.
  
<ins>Remember: There is no 100% that you aren't going to get banned.</ins>

That's all for now! I think I did put my weekend to good use at the end.

See you again when the right time comes around üëã.
