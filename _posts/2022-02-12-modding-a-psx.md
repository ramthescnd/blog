title: Repairing & Modding a dead PlayStation 1
published: true
---

So last month I bought a "dead" Playstation 1 (PSX) on Ebay for around 10‚Ç¨. The Seller described the item as "non-functional". Ordered it, arrived 3 Days later, took a look on it.

I plugged it into to socket, plugged the AV-cable in, and turned it on.
Nothing, only the green LED lid up, so at least the power supply wasn't the problem.

I took this opportunity to get more comfortable in SMD Stuff.  
The first thing I did was to clean the mainboard with Isopropanol, because I did saw some unidentifiable liquid on the mainboard.

Who knew, maybe it was classic coke ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è?

After that I was ready to measure some fuses, and as it turns out the main power fuse labeled "PS604" was blown. That one provides power from the power supply to mainboard. I searched the internet and bought a replacement fuse for 0,89‚Ç¨, what a steal! The fuse did arrive 5-6 Days later.    I desoldered the old fuse with a pretty heavy amount of flux and the soldered the new one on. 

As you can see, It actually wasn't that difficult:

It‚Äôs alive ü§ñüëç.

I will make this console fully retro, I ordered a transparent blue shell. The one that came with the console is super scratched, like I couldn't even make it look good anymore.  I also ordered a popular PSX modchip called the "xStation", and a custom 3D-printed SD-card mount.

It's a damn beauty üòç!

I bought some old-stock from a trusted ebay seller, but really don't ask me how much this thing costed me. I just couldn't resist üò¨.  

<u>24.04.2022 - The xStation arrived </u>

You read that right folks, it's finally here!
The installation was fairly easy (for me at least), the xStation came in a nice environment-friendly packaging. Inside were the 2 QCB's for each console revision (550X & 100X). I opened the console up, but I had to remove the metal-shielding that was covering most of the IC's that I had to solder to.

The first part was to lift some Pins on the CXD2545Q (digital signal processor that serves the CD-drive), which looks really complicated. For that I ordered some tiny tips for soldering iron.
I heated up the pads that held pins and lifted them up with a pair of tweezers.

As you can see I insulated the pins with electrical tape, looks pretty clean so I far I would say.

Now that the "hardest" was done I moved over to solder the corresponding QSB to the mainboard. I pre-tined my iron, put flux on the board and started to solder.
Honestly this was a breeze to install, I felt like flying over the VIA-points with my iron üßö.

Only one wire is missing üòÖ.By the way I also had to remove a small capacitor that was sitting right next to the "B" that you see on the mainboard, sadly I don't have pictures of that.

Now that the soldering part is done,I just need to secure the flexcable and put the actual xStation onto the socket where the CD-drive was sitting before.

You might have noticed that the SD-card mount is still not here.  Well that's true, Im still waiting for it. Maybe I actually got scammed out of 8‚Ç¨. The console still looks sleek without it ‚ú®.

And there you go!

From an old console I bought off ebay for a mere 10‚Ç¨ to a fully functional retro-modded Playstation 1. I love this thing so much üòç.
