title: A wild NES appears! - an Update
published: true
---

I've always wanted a first generation Nintendo console and thanks to a coworker of mine (If you read this you are awesome 😉) I finally managed to get one, he was so nice in fact that he gifted it to me. As I promised not to disappoint him, I will update this post as I continue working on it.  
I think it's a nice project to work on while I'm waiting for the xStation for my Playstation 1.

<ins>Here's a picture of the NES:</ins>

I thought about buying one of these EVERDRIVES, and in fact there exists one for the NES. On the market are currently the "N8" and the "N8 Pro" available. The two reason why I am not (and also can't) buying these is because:

a.) they are really expensive, we are talking about 120€ here  
b.) the main storage unit is based in Ukraine, and we all know what tragedy is happening there

Maybe I'm gonna buy an EVERDRIVE one day, but not now. What I'm going to buy is a chemical substance called "retr0bright", which is a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and glycerin. As you can see the NES has a yellow chime on it's case, after 36 years that is totally understandable, but we are going to get rid of it 🧫👨‍🔬. I know my grades in chemistry weren't that good, but there is always space for improvement!

So when I got the time (and chemical substances) I will continue this post.

<u>Update:</u> 

As some of you may have noticed, its finally summer outside ☀️!
Don't think that I forgot this project, I just waited for the best time to do it 😉. Hydrogen peroxide only bleaches something when you give it a little "push", and in this case that "push" needs to be either a blacklight (which I don't have access to and I'm probably not going to buy it.) or the sunlight ☀️.  
I ordered hydrogen peroxide from Amazon (also gloves and some nice protective glasses) today  and  when it's ready  
I'm finally going to give that poor NES a good old rub!

So, until then (hopefully soon)!
