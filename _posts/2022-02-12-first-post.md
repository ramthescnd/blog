title:  "Repairing a dead PlayStation 1 (SCPH-1002)"
---

Hello!

So, im currently doing a repair on a Playstation 1. I bought the actual console as untested on ebay for only 10â‚¬.
I mean, who could say no that deal?

Up on opening it up, I first noticed that all the cover screws were missing. Not that bad, made my job a little bit easier :^).
Then I saw it, a quite sticky substance was all over the mainboard. Maybe coke, or oil? I'm no expert at that.
I removed it with isopropyl alcohol, gave that board a good old cleaning, maybe fixing it on that way?

Plugged the power supply back in aaannnd nothing, except for a green light. So it surely couldnt be the power supply.
Then I asked around in forums, reading my way through the internet. Then it came to my head like a lightingstrike..
A very helpful guy pointed me to the main power fuse on the board (he also provided me with a full diagram of the model, very useful!)
So I checked it with my multimeter and sure enough it was dead. To be sure I checked all the other fuses on the board, and I was relaxed when all the other ones turned out to be good.

So I ordered a new one, that would ofcourse fit the voltages..

When they arrive, Im gonna post my progress here. EVEN WITH PICTURES! (because it looks fancy, and to practice my HTML/CSS skills more ;))

So, see ya!
