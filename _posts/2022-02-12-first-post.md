title: Repairing a dead PlayStation 1 (SCPH-1002)
published: true

So last month I bought a "dead" Playstation 1 on Ebay for around 10â‚¬. The Seller described the item as "non-functional". Ordered it, arrived 3 Days later, took a look on it.

I plugged it into to socket, plugged the AV-cable in, and turned it on.
Nothing, only the green LED lid up, so atleast the power supply wasnt the problem.

I took this opportunity to get more comfortable in SMD Stuff. The first thing I did was to clean the mainboard with Isopropanol, because I did saw some unidentifiable liquid on the mainboard.

Who knew? Maybe it was classic coke :D?

After that I was ready to meassure some fuses, and as it turns out the main power fuse PS604 was blown. That one provides power from the power supply to mainboard. I searched the internet and bought a replacement fuse for 0,89â‚¬. The fuse did arrive 5-6 Days later. Desoldered the old fuse with a pretty heavy amount of flux and the soldered the new one on. 

It actually was not that difficult:

And is it turns out, the console is fixed! Its alive ðŸ¤–!

I will make this console fully retro, I ordered a transparent blue shell. The one that came with the console is super scratched, like I cant even make it look good anymore. I also ordered a popular PSX modchip called the "xStation", and a custom 3D-printed SD-card mount.

I will keep this post updated, and as soon as the parts arrive I will post pictures ðŸ˜Š!

Until then, happy reparing & modding!
