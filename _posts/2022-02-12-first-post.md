title: Repairing & Modding a dead PlayStation (SCPH-1002)
published: true

So last month I bought a "dead" Playstation 1 on Ebay for around 10‚Ç¨. The Seller described the item as "non-functional". Ordered it, arrived 3 Days later, took a look on it.

I plugged it into to socket, plugged the AV-cable in, and turned it on.
Nothing, only the green LED lid up, so atleast the power supply wasnt the problem.

I took this opportunity to get more comfortable in SMD Stuff. The first thing I did was to clean the mainboard with Isopropanol, because I did saw some unidentifiable liquid on the mainboard.

Who knew? Maybe it was classic coke :D?

After that I was ready to meassure some fuses, and as it turns out the main power fuse PS604 was blown. That one provides power from the power supply to mainboard. I searched the internet and bought a replacement fuse for 0,89‚Ç¨. The fuse did arrive 5-6 Days later. Desoldered the old fuse with a pretty heavy amount of flux and the soldered the new one on. 

It actually was not that difficult:

![Replaced_Fuse]({{ "/media/Replaced_Fuse.png" | absolute_url }})

And is it turns out, the console is fixed! Its alive ü§ñ!

I will make this console fully retro, I ordered a transparent blue shell. The one that came with the console is super scratched, like I cant even make it look good anymore. I also ordered a popular PSX modchip called the "xStation", and a custom 3D-printed SD-card mount.

I will keep this post updated, and as soon as the parts arrive I will post pictures üòä!

<u>20.03.2022 - The custom shell arrived </u>

The shell just arrivied, and just look at it:

![Replaced_Fuse]({{ "/media/psx_shell.png" | absolute_url }})

Its a damn beauty üòç!

Its old-stock from a trusted ebay seller, but really dont ask me how much this thing costed me.  
I just could not resist üò¨.
So, Im still waiting for the xStation and the 3D-printed SD-mount. 

You know how things go...

Until then, happy repairing & modding!
