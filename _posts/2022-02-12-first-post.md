## Repairing & Modding a dead PlayStation (SCPH-1002)


So last month I bought a "dead" Playstation 1 (PSX) on Ebay for around 10€. The Seller described the item as "non-functional". Ordered it, arrived 3 Days later, took a look on it.

I plugged it into to socket, plugged the AV-cable in, and turned it on.
Nothing, only the green LED lid up, so at least the power supply wasn't the problem.

I took this opportunity to get more comfortable in SMD Stuff. The first thing I did was to clean the mainboard with Isopropanol, because I did saw some unidentifiable liquid on the mainboard.

Who knew, maybe it was classic coke 🤷‍♂️?

After that I was ready to measure some fuses, and as it turns out the main power fuse labeled "PS604" was blown. That one provides power from the power supply to mainboard. I searched the internet and bought a replacement fuse for 0,89€, what a steal! The fuse did arrive 5-6 Days later. I desoldered the old fuse with a pretty heavy amount of flux and the soldered the new one on. 

As you can see, It actually wasn't that difficult:

![Replaced_Fuse]({{ "/media/Replaced_Fuse.png" | absolute_url }})

It’s alive 🤖👍.

I will make this console fully retro, I ordered a transparent blue shell. The one that came with the console is super scratched, like I couldn't even make it look good anymore.  
I also ordered a popular PSX modchip called the "xStation", and a custom 3D-printed <br>SD-card mount.

I will keep this post updated, and as soon as the parts arrive I will post pictures 😊!

<u>20.03.2022 - The custom shell arrived </u>

![Replaced_Fuse]({{ "/media/psx_shell.png" | absolute_url }})

It's a damn beauty 😍!

I bought some old-stock from a trusted ebay seller, but really don't ask me how much this thing costed me. I just couldn't resist 😬.  I’m still waiting (as of 07.04.2022) for the xStation and the 3D-printed SD-mount for the ODE, but at least I finally got tracking number.

As soon as the other parts arrive I will continue this post 😉.

Until then, happy repairing & modding!
