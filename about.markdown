<ins> Hello Stranger!</ins>
<br>
<br>
My name is Kai Wittenburg, 21 years old and probably your average nerd. I really like to repair electronic devices, mostly laptops, smartphones, consoles & sometimes cameras. I also soft or hardmod them.Every device that I own is in some way modified, isn't that awesome?  I'm equipped with the needed tools such as an multimeter, a microscope or my awesome soldering station.  
While I'm repairing, I document my progress on this little blog of mine.

<br>
Why throw everything away when you can just repair it for a mere amount of money?
